k.iosevka
=========

A custom build of Iosevka [1] for personal use. A preview of the typeface can
be found at Julia as a CLI calculator [2].

Build
-----

The compiled fonts can be found on the release [3] page, but just in case you
want to build it yourself, here is the instructions:

First, npm, ttfautohint, otfcc, AFDKO are required to build this typeface. If
you are using Arch Linux and yay, the dependencies can be installed via AUR.

    $ yay -S npm otfcc ttfautohint afdko

Then, use the makefile to take care of everything.

    $ make setup
    $ make build

The output is in the `out` directory.

Nerd fonts patch
----------------

The term variant is intended to be used in the terminal, and it is sometimes
necessary to patch the font with Nerd fonts [4] to add additional symbols for
various terminal applications.

Fontforge and subversion are required to apply the patch.  I'm using subversion
here only because it is a pain to download a single folder from GitHub. Follow
the instruction in `Makefile` if you want to use git instead. Otherwise,
install the dependencies via

    $ yay -S fontforge subversion

Then run the patcher by

    $ make setup-nerd
    $ make patch

The patched fonts can be found in the `patched` directory. They are internally
referenced by the name `k.iosevka.term Nerd Font`.
